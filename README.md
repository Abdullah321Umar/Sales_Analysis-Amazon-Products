# 📊 Sales Analysis | Amazon Products Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview
I developed a dynamic and interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key metrics related to Amazon product sales. The goal of the dashboard was to offer actionable insights into product performance, sales trends, regional distribution, and customer buying patterns—helping e-commerce teams and business stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.
